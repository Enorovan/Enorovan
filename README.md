### â˜€ Software and DevOps Engineer by day
Professionally, I'm a Software Engineer in a French company, with some skills in DevOps and Infrastructure. I work on a React/Next.js and Java stack, hosted on GCP.

### ðŸŒ™ Translator and Game Developper by night
In my free time, I'm a Japanese to English/French translator, as well as a maintainer of tools made for game modification. Those tools use multiple languages or framework, such as C++, Qt, Rust, Python, or Powershell. I also contribute to an open-source reimplementation of a game engine, developped on C++ for OpenGL, Vulkan and DirectX.
